/*Retrospective
Using built-in methods are good in that they simplify the workaround for getting the output. That said, sometimes there might not built-in methods for the result I want and in occurrence, I have to make a custom function to get things done. 
In this challenge, for `reverseString` function, I tried both manual and built-in way. Especially, knowing the `unshift` array method was the key in solving the problem.
